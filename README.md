# Portfolio Website for Hussein (Developer)

This project is a one-page portfolio website for Hussein, a developer specializing in graphics, websites, web apps, systems, and various digital solutions.

## Based On

The design and structure are based on a reference website provided by the client, featuring:
- A sleek dark theme.
- Interactive UI elements.
- Responsive design.
- A fixed header that remains visible on scroll.
- A distinctive black-and-white to color hover effect on project images.

## Customization

The website is customized with Hussein's brand logo, color scheme, and service offerings.
- **Brand Name:** Code by Hussein
- **Tagline:** "You need it built? I'll build it. You need it fixed? Say less."

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox and Grid for layout)
- JavaScript (for interactions and animations)

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository (or download the files).
2.  Place your logo image as `logo.png` in the `images/` directory.
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `css/style.css`: All CSS styles.
- `js/main.js`: JavaScript for interactivity.
- `images/`: Directory for images (including `logo.png`).
- `projects/images/`: Directory for project showcase images (to be added).

## Development Notes

- The website is built as a single page with smooth scrolling navigation.
- Placeholder content will be used for projects and testimonials initially.
- The abstract background effect for the hero section (and potentially other sections) will be implemented using CSS or a subtle image/SVG.
